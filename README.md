Melanoma Detection using CNN:

Intent of the Analysis:

Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Here we are attempting to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

This CNN model can can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.



The steps followed:
Step 1: Understanding the use case
Step 2: Generating bse model.
Step 3: Improvising the base model by incorporating techniques like Dropouts, normalization and Augmentation.
Step 4: Compring the summary statisics to identify the best model.

Technologies used: Python incorporated with Pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib modules. Git.

Files contained:
CNN_assignment: 
The jupiter notebook file in which the code is present.
The Train and Test images.
